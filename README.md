# Spider Example Project

This project demonstrates the usage of the [`spider`](https://pub.dev/packages/spider) package in a Flutter application. The `spider` package provides a tool to visualize widget tree structures, making it easier for developers to debug and understand the layout and hierarchy of their Flutter applications.

## Package Overview

**Spider** is a small Dart library designed to automate the generation of Dart code for referencing assets in a Flutter project. It generates a Dart class with static constant variables that map directly to the assets in your project. This method eliminates the risk of string typos when referencing assets and provides IDE auto-complete support, making it very handy when you have a large number of assets to manage.

### Benefits

- **Error-Free Asset Reference:** No more typos in asset paths, ensuring reliable referencing.
- **IDE Auto-Complete Support:** Easily find and reference assets with the help of IDE suggestions.
- **Simplified Code:** Makes it more readable and cleaner by avoiding the need to manually type out asset paths.

### Example

Hereâ€™s how you would typically use the `spider` package to reference assets in your project:

#### Before

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Image(image: AssetImage('assets/background.png'));
}
```

#### After
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Image(image: AssetImage(Assets.background));
}
```
#### Generated Assets Class
```dart
class Assets {
  static const String background = 'assets/background.png';
}
```
